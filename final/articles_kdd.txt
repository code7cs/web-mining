Kristen LeFevre:David J. DeWitt:Raghu Ramakrishnan	Protecting data privacy is an important problem in microdata distribution. Anonymization algorithms typically aim to protect individual privacy, with minimal impact on the quality of the resulting data. While the bulk of previous work has measured quality through one-size-fits-all measures, we argue that quality is best judged with respect to ...	Workload-aware anonymization	NA	2006
Siyu Lei:Silviu Maniu:Luyi Mo:Reynold Cheng:Pierre Senellart	Social networks are commonly used for marketing purposes. For example, free samples of a product can be given to a few influential social network users (or seed nodes), with the hope that they will convince their friends to buy it. One way to formalize this objective is through the problem ...	Online Influence Maximization	NA	2015

NA	Our society as we know it, is going through a fundamental digital transformation. Fueling this transformation is the insights we gain from data in service of one and in service of all. We are holding the future in our hands and therefore share both the excitement and the responsibility of ...	KDD '19: Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining	NA	2019
NA	The KDD conference has seen remarkable growth since its origins as an IJCAI workshop in Detroit in 1989, evolving into a full-fledged research conference in 1995, underscoring the important role data mining as a field has played in extracting knowledge and actionable insights from vast troves of data that is ...
